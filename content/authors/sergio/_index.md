More than 10 years of experience around Systems Administration and Devops practices.

**Passionate** about **Cloud Computing, Cloud Native Applications, Monitoring** and everything working around them ensuring a site keeps running smoothly 24x7.

**There's nothing I hate more than doing manual stuff**, if I think something may need to be done twice, I always see it as an opportunity to automate it, **my motto** is: **if there is an API, let's automate it!!**

I've always been a FOSS enthusiast, but once I joined Red Hat **I realized even more about the importance about Open Source**, and since then my real journey on FOSS has started, contributing to different projects, as well as sharing some tools I use regularly that **can help folks around the Globe**.

On September 2019 I started as a **Guest Speaker** on **[Cloud Native Barcelona Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/es/Cloud-Native-Barcelona)**, organized by my friend and colleague [Rael García](https://rael.io).
