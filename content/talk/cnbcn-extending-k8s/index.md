## Agenda

### 18:30 Welcome

> Introduction to the Cloud Native community and Glovo!

### 18:45 Kubernetes Architecture

> Introduction to the core principles an components of the Kubernetes architecture. We will start a Kubernetes cluster from scratch, component by component learning how each piece fits into the puzzle.

- [github.com/raelga/kubernetes-talks/tree/master/k8s-from-scratch](https://github.com/raelga/kubernetes-talks/tree/master/k8s-from-scratch)

### 19:40 Break

### 19:45 Kubernetes Custom Controllers and Operators in action

> Introduction to the Operator concept. We will deploy some operators in a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster step by step and build our own Operator without (almost) writing any code.

- [github.com/raelga/extending-kubernetes/tree/master/labs/ansible-operators](github.com/raelga/extending-kubernetes/tree/master/labs/ansible-operators)
